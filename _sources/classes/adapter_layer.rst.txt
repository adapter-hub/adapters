Adapter Implementation
=======================

The following classes define the common interfaces for all adapter methods.
They further hold logic shared by all adapter implementations.
All newly added adapter methods should inherit from either one of these classes.

.. autoclass:: adapters.AdapterLayerBase
    :members:

.. autoclass:: adapters.ComposableAdapterLayerBase
    :members:
