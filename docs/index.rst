AdapterHub Documentation
================================================

.. note::
   This documentation is based on the new *Adapters* library.

   The documentation based on the legacy *adapter-transformers* library can be found at: `https://docs-legacy.adapterhub.ml <https://docs-legacy.adapterhub.ml>`_.

*AdapterHub* is a framework simplifying the integration, training and usage of adapters and other efficient fine-tuning methods for Transformer-based language models.
For a full list of currently implemented methods, see the `table in our repository <https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapters#implemented-methods>`_.

The framework consists of two main components:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - `Adapters <https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapters>`_
     - `AdapterHub.ml <https://adapterhub.ml/explore>`_
   * - an add-on to Hugging Face's `Transformers <https://huggingface.co/transformers/>`_ library that adds adapters into transformer models
     - a central collection of pre-trained adapter modules

Currently, we support the PyTorch versions of all models as listed on the `Model Overview <model_overview.html>`_ page.
