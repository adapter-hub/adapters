# Model Overview

This page gives an overview of the Transformer models currently supported by `adapters`.
The table below further shows which model architectures support which adaptation methods and which features of `adapters`.

```{eval-rst}
.. note::
    Each supported model architecture X typically provides a class ``XAdapterModel`` for usage with ``AutoAdapterModel``.
    Additionally, it is possible to use adapters with the model classes already shipped with Hugging Face Transformers. For these classes, initialize the model for adapters with `adapters.init(model)`.
    E.g., for BERT, this means adapters provides a ``BertAdapterModel`` class, but you can also use ``BertModel``, ``BertForSequenceClassification`` etc. together with adapters.

**Missing a model architecture you'd like to use?**
adapters can be easily extended to new model architectures as described in [Adding Adapters to a Model](https://docs.adapterhub.ml/contributing/adding_adapters_to_a_model.html).
Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapters/issues) requesting support for a new architecture.
_We very much welcome pull requests adding new model implementations!_
