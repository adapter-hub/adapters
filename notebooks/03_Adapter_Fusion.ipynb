    "# 3️⃣ Combining Pre-Trained Adapters using AdapterFusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In [the previous notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Adapter-Hub/adapter-transformers/blob/master/notebooks/02_Adapter_Inference.ipynb), we loaded a single pre-trained adapter from _AdapterHub_. Now we will explore how to take advantage of multiple pre-trained adapters to combine their knowledge on a new task. This setup is called **AdapterFusion** ([Pfeiffer et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00247.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this guide, we select **CommitmentBank** ([De Marneffe et al., 2019](https://github.com/mcdm/CommitmentBank)), a three-class textual entailment dataset, as our target task. We will fuse [adapters from AdapterHub](https://adapterhub.ml/explore/) which were pre-trained on different tasks. During training, their represantions are kept fix while a newly introduced fusion layer is trained. As our base model, we will use BERT (`bert-base-uncased`). "
