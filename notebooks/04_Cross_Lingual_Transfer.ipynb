    "# 4️⃣ Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer using Adapters\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond AdapterFusion, which we trained in [the previous notebook](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapter-transformers/blob/master/notebooks/04_Cross_Lingual_Transfer.ipynb), we can compose adapters for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer between tasks. We will use the stacked adapter setup presented in **MAD-X** ([Pfeiffer et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00052.pdf)) for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the base model is a pre-trained multilingual **XLM-R** (`xlm-roberta-base`) ([Conneau et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02116.pdf)) model. Additionally, two types of adapters, language adapters and task adapters, are used. Here's how the MAD-X process works in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train language adapters for the source and target language on a language modeling task. In this notebook, we won't train them ourselves but use [pre-trained language adapters from the Hub](https://adapterhub.ml/explore/text_lang/).\n",
    "2. Train a task adapter on the target task dataset. This task adapter is **stacked** upon the previously trained language adapter. During this step, only the weights of the task adapter are updated.\n",
    "3. Perform zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. In this last step, we simply replace the source language adapter with the target language adapter while keeping the stacked task adapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to our concrete example: we select **XCOPA** ([Ponti et al., 2020](https://ducdauge.github.io/files/xcopa.pdf)), a multilingual extension of the **COPA** commonsence reasoning dataset ([Roemmele et al., 2011](https://people.ict.usc.edu/~gordon/publications/AAAI-SPRING11A.PDF)) as our target task. The setup is trained on the original **English** dataset and then transferred to **Chinese**."
